Support is fragmented, often deficit-based, and overly clinical — leaving individuals uncertain where to begin or how to build real-world confidence and skills.SolutionResilience Compass provides a single entry point to Neuro Resilience services, helping users identify opportunities that suit their interests and comfort levels.* Interest Filters: Creative / Skills / Tech / Outdoors / Social / Reflective / Innovation* Comfort Filters: Low (quiet / 1-to-1) | Medium | High (small group / public)* Personalised Results: Opportunities within Resilience Hub, Pathways, Program, Studio, Collective, and Youth* Engagement Feedback: Users can tap “Helpful” or suggest ideas to inform future mapping.* Motivation Hooks: Positive micro-copy (“Start where you are”, “Find your first step”) and gentle progress visuals.* Discovery Line: “Find practical ways to build skills, purpose, and connection.”* Subline: “Use the Resilience Compass to explore your opportunities with Neuro Resilience.”* Optional alt tagline for social media: “Explore what’s possible through Neuro Resilience.”Success Metrics1. % of users who click “I’m Interested” or complete a referral form2.
